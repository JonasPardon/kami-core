# Kami CMS
This is a pretty barebones CMS (still a work in progress) with the aim of trying my hand at a bit of freelancing for simple websites. The top priorities are ease of use and being user friendly.

## Usage
Kami is a self-hosted CMS that runs on Laravel and Vue, with Inertia.js to bind those two together.
You will need PHP 7.2 or higher.

This repository is the core package, and will not function on its own. You will need to include this package in a Laravel project (you can find the boilerplate laravel project [here](https://github.com/JonasPardon/kami-boilerplate)).
